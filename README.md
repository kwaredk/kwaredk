Welcome to K-Ware's open source repository.
Here you can find some of the useful utilities I'm using to develop Java.

- 👀 I’m interested in SPA, PWA, Spring boot, Android apps, ESP32, Arduino and utilities to easier code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to support an ongoing Smart home project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Home Assistant.
- 📫 If you have any questions or requests, you are welcome to contact me at support@kware.dk
